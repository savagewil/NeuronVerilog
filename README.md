# NeuronVerilog
Its a Neuron Written in System Verilog

They can be chained and can learn many functions. Back propogation is build in.
Below is the error rate of three neurons learning XOR. 
They are layed out like this:
<!-- language: lang-none -->
    Input----O
          \ / \
           X   O----Out
          / \ / 
    Input----O
